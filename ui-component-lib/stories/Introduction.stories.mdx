# Introduction

This Storybook instance holds the React components for the UserClouds UI. It is divided into Components and Layouts. Components are the smaller building blocks that are used inside the Layouts.

Built out of pages is hosted at https://userclouds-pages.genoni.dev/.

## Component philosophy

Most components are setup to extend their native HTML element so that any valid attribute can be passed through.

Exceptions to this are the `<Button>`, `<Anchor>` and `<IconButton>` components that each output either a `button` or `a` element depending on certain props.
