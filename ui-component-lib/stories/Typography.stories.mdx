# Typography

The `<Heading>` and `<Text>` components are the root for all type in UserClouds UI. Any text used in the UI should use one of these components. Complete documentation for each of these components is available in the Components section.

- [Heading](/docs/components-heading--size-1)
- [Text](/docs/components-text--size-1)

## Headlines

Uses the `<Heading>` component with a `size` prop. If for page structure and SEO reasons the element should be a `h1`, `h2`, etc., this component takes an optional `headingLevel` prop. Otherwise the element is a `<div>`.

## Text

Uses the `<Text>` component with a `size` prop. This component defaults to `<p>` element but has an optional `elementName` for other elements like `<span>`, `<code>`, etc.
