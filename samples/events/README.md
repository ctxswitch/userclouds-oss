# UserClouds Events Sample App

This app demonstrates how to use Plex and the UserClouds AuthZ service.

## Running Events

Execute `go run main.go` to run the Events app.

By default this will target the locally-running dev instances of Plex and AuthZ. You'll want to run `make dev` in a separate prompt to ensure that's running.
