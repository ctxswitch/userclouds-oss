# UserClouds Rolodex Sample App

This app demonstrates how to use consented purposes with UserStore accessors and mutators.

## How to Run

Execute `go run .` to run the app.

By default this will target the locally-running dev instances of our UserClouds backend services. Edit .env to change the UC_TENANT_BASE_URL, PLEX_CLIENT_ID, or PLEX_CLIENT_SECRET. If you are targeting a local tenant, make sure the UserClouds services are running.
